Good Day,

I do not know much about you and how you will take this message but am
doing this based on my Christian faith and what  tomorrow will be. I am Dr.
Mark Jimo, the office assistant to the Central Bank Governor ( Mr. Olayemi
Michael Cardoso).I am  not telling you this to impress you or to gain any
favor from you, rather I am doing this to save you from  further damage
 and pai. I have done this to two people already, though they betrayed me
at the end. Before I proceed, you must promise me  that nobody will know of
this and after you are satisfied with my job, you can help me in whatever
way the spirit of
God directs you.
This is very secret, I overheard Dr. Olayemi Michael Cardoso and other bank
 executives here in Nigeria saying that they will  make sure you spend and
pay much fees till you are tired and abandoned your UN/ World Bank Approved
compensation amount of  $10,000,000.00 (Ten million United States Dollars)
for them to later divert to an already opened offshore
account in USA. Please do not pay anything to anyone again regarding  the
release of your fund(ATM CARD) because none of  these evil perpetrators
have your interest in heart. The President of Nigeria and the members of
his Federal Executive  Council have since endorsed the payment of this
overdue fund approved compensation fund to you and your account is  already
activated which you can access at any time and your ATM card programmed and
ready to dispatch to you. It is just that  some of our bank executives are
very greedy and they have created avenues to steal your money even when
they know that the  situation is very critical. I and another Christian
colleague in the office have to help you out.
Now, we have perfectly pulled out the ATM card that contains your UN/World
Bank Compensation payment amount . We are ready to  send it to you
immediately, PLEASE, our job is on the line. I am only 54 years married
with two kids (A Boy and A Girl) and I  don't want to ruin my future or die
at this early age. I do not make calls on transactions
like this due to the sensitive nature of this transaction and my position
with the CBN. I will not deliver this ATM card to  you if you let anyone
know of this.

If this arrangement is OK with you please reply now and we will send the
ATM card to you through DHL and all these horrendous  and callous treatment
will stop and you will happily receive your funds to your designated home
address.
I shall attach my personal identifications to you as soon as I hear from
you positively.
Get back to me if you are interested so that we can proceed.

Regards.


Dr. Mark Jimo
Office assistant to the Central Bank Governor
