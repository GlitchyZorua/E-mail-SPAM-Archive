Hello Dearest,

I am writing to you with tears falling down my eyes and My name is Miss.
Mireille Yapi, I am a single girl  17 years ,and an Ivory Citizen, But I
and my parents relocated to Turkey when the war broke out in Ivory Coast
2011 since then we have been living in Turkey Gaziantep province until the
recent earthquake that made me lose my parents which has affected me so
much.

I relocated to Cote D'Ivoire after the death and funeral of my beloved
family   and I could not go back again to Turkey due to lack of money and
no one will be helping me over there since my parents are no more .

I need your kind and urgent assistance to build a sincere and honest
relationship with me, My late parents deposited US$75 Million Dollars cash
in a bank in Ivory Coast ( Banque Atlantique Cote D'Ivoire and I have gone
to the bank for the release of the fund which they refuse me access due to
am not of aged instead advise that I should bring my guardian /trustee who
can stand for me for the release of the fund or I should wait till am 21
majority' age which is not possible because no one to help me and I don=E2=
=80=99t
want my father=E2=80=99s family to know about this fund as they have take
everything that belong to my late father and left me with nothing
Meanwhile, I wish to solicit for your services to be my foreign
partner/Investor and support me to transfer and manage my funds by
investing it in profit making ventures like buying of company shares, Real
Estate Investment Trust funds, or Agriculture.

I am ready to part 20% of the entire funds to you as your own gratification
while the 80% will be strictly for the investment and my education. At the
successful transfer of the investment I will relocate to your country to
further my education and start a new life over there.

I have no experience or perfection in running a business, I would like you
to help me out so that I can further my education and invest the fund in
your country. I will send to you all the documents related to the funds and
with your good intention to assist me.

May God bless you earnestly,
Yours Sincerely daughter,
Miss. Mireille Yapi
