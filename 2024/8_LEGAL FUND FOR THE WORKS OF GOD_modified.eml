God Bless You,
Calvary Greetings in the name of the LORD Almighty and Our LORD JESUS
CHRIST the giver of every good thing. Good day and compliments of the
seasons, i know this letter will definitely come to you as a huge surprise,
but I implore you to take the time to go through it carefully as the
decision you make will go a long way to determine my future and continued
existence. I am Mrs.Ruhama Koenig aging widow of 62 years old suffering
from long time illness.I have some funds I inherited from my late husband,
the sum of ($18,500,000.00 Million Dollars) and I needed a very honest and
God fearing  who can withdraw this money then use the funds for Charity
works. I WISH TO GIVE THIS FUNDS TO YOU FOR CHARITY WORKS. I found your
email address from the internet after honest prayers to the LORD to bring
me a helper and I decided to contact you if you may be willing and
interested to handle these trust funds in good faith before anything
happens to me.

I accept this decision because I do not have any child who will inherit
this money after I die. I want your urgent reply to me so that I will give
you the deposit receipt which the SECURITY COMPANY issued to me as next of
kin for immediate transfer of the money to your account in your country, to
start the good work of God, I want you to use the 40/percent of the total
amount to help yourself in doing the project. I am desperately in need of
assistance and I have summoned up the courage to contact you for this task,
you must not fail me and the millions of poor people in our world today.
This is no stolen money and there are no dangers involved,100% RISK FREE
with full legal proof. Please if you would be able to use the funds for the
Charity works kindly let me know immediately. I will appreciate your utmost
confidentiality and trust in this matter to accomplish my heart's desire,
as I don't want anything that will jeopardize my last wish.

Please kindly respond quickly for more details and also include your
details like: Your full names, Your country/Address, Your occupation and
your phone number.

Warmest Regards,
Mrs.Ruhama Koenig
