These are emails that land into my inbox that i think are funny, infamous or just stuck out to me... 

Not all of these are spam mail.


Notes
- The NEWAPP.BAS was a Basic virus that was deployed to random email addresses on April 1st 2024. I assume it was just a funny joke, so i decided to put it in the archive anyways.
