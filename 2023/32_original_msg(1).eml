Sir
The Secretary of the United States Department of the Treasury wishes to
inform you that
there is an on-going reimbursement payment program with the help of the
United
Nations,Federal Trade Commission  and Federal Reserve Bank Board to
expedite the release
of all outstanding compensation  inheritance/relief funds owed to
individuals and small
businesses and be sure that all funds are paid to befitting beneficiaries
before the end
of this Month of December,2023.
Due to this development, We have been assigned to step into the immediate
processing of
all outstanding payments to enable all beneficiaries to receive their funds
as soon as
possible. Fortunately,you have been selected alongside a few other
beneficiaries to
receive a payment of $3,500,00000 ( Three Million Five Hundred Thousand
United States
Dollars only ) through the Federal Authority .
To implement this, you are to get back to me immediately with the below
details before your payment file is cancelled
(1) Full Names
(2) Residential Address
(3) Date of Birth
(4) Phone/Cell Number
(5) Occupation
In conclusion, it is my concern to demand your ultimate honesty and
cooperation to enable
us to expedite this.  As I guarantee you that this process would be
executed under a
legitimate arrangement that would legally protect you from any breach of
Law.

Get back to me at your earliest convenience.
Yours in service,
James Dudley Saunders Jr
Consultant/Payment liaison officer,
United Nations Regional Information Center,
New York,United States Of America
