Sir,

This is very urgent and your attention is needed.

In our office sometime last month, One Mr. John T. Kehoe of 1200 Fitch Way,
Sacramento, CA. 95864 USA; filed an application contrary to your pending
inheritance fund. The above mentioned person visited this bank last week
with a Power of Attorney given in his favor by your good self, granting him
the benefit to process and claim your inheritance of $15,000,000.00 for
personal reasons.

He further stated that the online account details be terminated while the
fund should be wired to his bank account with CHASE BANK, Account #
869210755, Routing # 021202337. We have asked Mr. John T. Kehoe to come
back to the bank next week to enable us to have a personal confirmation
from you, being hitherto the beneficiary. The Board of Directors discovered
some foul play, and decided to move the fund to our affiliate bank in
Germany.

* OUR OFFICES NEEDS TO KNOW:

1. Did you instruct one Mr. John T. Kehoe of 1200 Fitch way, Sacramento,
CA. 95864, to claim and receive the payment on your behalf?

2. Did you sign any 'Deed of Assignment' in his favor thereby making him
the current beneficiary?

We are sorry to have delayed your instruction in giving out this fund since
we must adhere to the procedures of this honorable bank by making sure this
request is verified and confirmed by the beneficiary and his existing
attorney.

Your confirmation to the above will be appreciated.

Regards,
Phillip Moore
