Because I am quite aware of your losses in the past years now through
this security office intelligent track devices, it may surprise you
that I am also aware of your unpaid transaction Pursuit for while ago,
My name Is Supp. Jeh Charles Johnson, the Former secretary of U.S
Department Of Homeland Security, i am in charge to monitor all Foreign
Transactions in Africa Europe and Asia and this kept me in constantly
traveling round the world, I have been in The U.S Department Of
Homeland Security Secret Service since The Government of our Former
President Barack Obama, monitoring the various transactions going on
in Africa, most especially Consignments Cases, A.T.M Card Cases And
Bank Transfer. I do not intend to spoil your day or to put you under
duress. But you can not receive any of your Consignments Boxes, A.T.M
Card And Bank Transfer pursuit, without a Clearance from the U.S
Department of Homeland Security. However, upon my arrival in Nairobi
Kenya after series of meetings with our President Joe Biden and United
Nations Secretary General Ant=C3=B3nio Guterres, due to numerous complains
from other Security Agencies in Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania,
Antarctica, South America And The United States Of America
Respectively, against the KENYA Government and Benin over the rate of
Scam/Fraudulent Activities going on in Africa Countries and around the
World.

When I arrived in Kenya Parliament! I went through all cases of unpaid
funds, and i found your Consignment Box Clearance File lying on the
Foreign Affair custody without any attention and on a thorough
scrutiny, I discovered that your Consignment have been abandoned by
your delivery agent. Meanwhile, I was made to understand that the
Foreign Affair Office has tried to reach you, but no way and they have
made several attempts to contact your delivery agent but to no avail.
To my greatest surprise, during my recent routine Re-Checking, I
personally discovered that your Consignment Content Declaration
Document (C.C.D.D) stated that your Consignment Contains Personal
Effects meanwhile, it contains United States Dollar Cash
US$10.5Million Dollars, (Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars) which made it impossible for the Consignment to be
delivered to you earlier before now. Based on this personal discovery,
I am contacting you now to let you know that with my position and
power as the Former secretary of U.S Department of Homeland Security
and now i am presently here in Nairobi Kenya to handle this matter of
all unpaid foreign payment to their respective owners like you, i can
assist you to legally clear your Consignment Funds and personally make
the shipment to you on my traveling back, but you must agree with the
following conditions. Because I have called our office in Washington,
Dc from here in KENYA, who has been intercepting all your E-Mail
Communications, telephone Text/Sms messages & all telephone Calls, I
also received some information from our Homeland Security Office
representing here in KENYA, they have Confirmed about your emails, &
other communications that you have been dealing and sending Money to
people in regards your unpaid Funds

State Dollars that was already handed over for me today, your
Consignment Box was assigned to me today after the meeting held
between myself and some of the top Parliament members of KENYA and the

Fees" and authorized the Government of Kenya to allow me fly with this
your approved Consignment Box to make the delivery for you without any
delay which they have agreed. The only Fee you will pay to confirm
Your Consignment Box received in your possession is the "Air Flight
Weight Fee" of your Consignment Box which is the sum of USD$150.00 and
