Re: Personal proposal
This mail is with heavy tears and great sorrow because i don't have any
other option than to open up to you all

However, I am Mrs. Jennifer Choo suffering from a long time cancer of the
breast and my conditions is really deteriorating and the doctors have
courageously advised me that I may not live long, because the cancer has
reached a critical stage and for this reason I contacted you.

I was brought up in a motherless baby's home and was married to my late
husband for many years without a child.
He was a pilot before his death and I decided not to remarry because of my
health and before his death; we have a family inheritance of five million,
six hundred thousand pounds treasure in London.

The management wrote me as the next of kin to come for the claim after
keeping it for so long or rather issue a letter of authorisation to someone
to do so on my behalf since I am terminally ill.
Failure will result to them reverting this inheritance to the state
treasury as unclaimed and possibly; divert it to themselves.
I am undergoing treatment and my last wish is to make sure this treasure is
secured.

I took this decision to enable me die in peace and please assure me that
you will act on humanitarian motives if given the opportunity.

Yours Sincerely
Mrs. Jennifer Choo.
