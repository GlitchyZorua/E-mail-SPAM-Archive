Dear Friend,

I got your reliable contact from your country=E2=80=99s Chamber of Commerce
Directory and further explicit investment information about your country. I
am Joy Helen, A retired Financial Consultant.

I had a client but because of his extended royal family history, which were
disseminated by the international media after their trial for financial
mismanagement and impropriety of US$14.8 Billion Dollars of which their
private companies were later confiscated and dissolved by then sultanate of
Brunei including many business documents that were destroyed and of which I
was the company's International Financial Consultant.

 Furthermore during this unfortunate period my office managed to dispatch
the sum of Two Hundred and Fifty Million United States Dollars (US$250,
000,000.00) in cash under special arrangement into the custody of an
Investment Bank here in the United Kingdom with the company Name and the
deposits are still valid till date.

Hence I seek your good assistance to partner with me so that we can
retrieve the funds and invest it into any profitable venture in your
country for our mutual benefit because based on my present predicament; I
do not have the capabilities to handle the transactions alone. All you need
to do is to contact the Bank where my office deposited the Money as my
Representative/Partner in business and request the firm to transfer the
funds to your Nominated Bank Account for further investment in your country=
.

Please I count on your absolute Confidentiality, Transparency and Trust
while looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion of
this business transaction.

Sincerely,
Joy Helen,
