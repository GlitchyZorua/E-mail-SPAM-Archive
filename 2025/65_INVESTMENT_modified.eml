Dear Carrie J. Troy,
It interests me as we went through your mail. I have discussed with the Inv=
estor, and he is ready and willing to invest in any viable project. We ther=
efore require that you send to us a detailed project/business plan(s) of th=
e said investment for our review. His investment capacity is US$30 Million.=
=C2=A0
The Investor, CEO,P M GLOBAL CONSORTIUM Company is interested in JV partner=
ship on any viable project with you acting as the manager and sole controll=
er of the investment while he remains a silent investor for a period of ten=
 years.
He does not want his government to know that he is investing outside his co=
untry as such he has requested that we maintain total confidentiality. As a=
 silent investor he does not want his government to know that he is investi=
ng outside the region.
Again, there is urgent need to have this fund transferred out of his bank a=
ccount to your safe bank account for immediate investment on any agreed pro=
ject/investment which a CONFIDENTIAL WORKING AGREEMENT(CWA) must be signed =
by both parties during a face-to-face meeting before any fund transfer to y=
our nominated account.
The Confidential Working CWA) will be sign between you and the company. I w=
ill send you the contact information of the company to enable you open up c=
ommunication with them and know when you come down to sign the agreement be=
fore the release of the fund to your account. I will send you the draft cop=
y of the agreement for you to study before coming down to sign the hard cop=
y with the company.Send a copy of international passport or national ID for=
 identification and your mobile number.

CONDITIONS: Investor is ready to grant a grace period of 6 to 12 Months as =
investment grace period for the investment to propagate prior to annual ret=
urn of ROI. Exit plan by investor out of the Investment/JV is on or after 1=
0 years depending on when you as the developer decide to return the core in=
terest in the management stream of the investment, so you will manage the b=
usiness. Investor has interest only on the income stream - to receive agree=
d yearly returns from Investment, so management and control of any investme=
nt will be left solely in your hands as the developer with expectation of r=
eturn of the annual agreed percentage.=C2=A0
Truely Yours,
Mohamed Usman
