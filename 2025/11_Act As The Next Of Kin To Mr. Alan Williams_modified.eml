Dear Friend,

How are you today? I am Desmond Lawrence, an assistant finance security
officer working in Treasury & FX Dealing at FTB Bank Cambodia. I am a
British National and I live in Cambodia. I need your help and support to
transfer the sum of Forty Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars
US$40,500.000.00 from the Treasury & FX Dealing at FTB Bank Cambodia, to
your bank account in your Country. You will be rewarded with 50% of the
total sum for your partnership and I will come over to meet you in your
country, for sharing of the money, immediately the money is transferred to
your bank account. Can you handle this?

The money was abandoned by a late customer Alan Williams, a British tycoon
who died with his family in a car accident on 20th of October 2021. The
money was left unclaimed in the Treasury & FX Dealing at FTB Bank Cambodia,
for safe keeping without a beneficiary.

You are to stand as beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, to enable the
Treasury & FX Dealing at FTB Bank Cambodia, to facilitate the fund release
and transfer to your bank account. I need your personal information and ID
to re-profile the funds with your data, to enable the Treasury & FX Dealing
at FTB Bank Cambodia to transfer the sum to you. The whole process of the
transaction will take not more than 10 days to successfully complete the
fund transfer to your bank account.

I will send you more details about the transaction as soon as I get your
response, to enable us to begin the transaction. I look forward to hearing
from you soon.

You can reply me back on these email:  [removed]


Yours Sincerely,
Mr.  Desmond Lawrence,
