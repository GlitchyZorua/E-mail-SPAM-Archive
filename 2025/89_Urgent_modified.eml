Greetings,

I am writing to you based on a request by an investor who is in urgent need
to relocate his assets overseas through your assistance, I am an
attorney/investment adviser here in Kenya.

I am representing the interests of very wealthy investors mainly from East
and North Africa. Due to the sensitivity of their position they hold in
their organization and the unstable investment environment of their
countries, they prefer to channel/move the majority of their funds into
more stable economies and developing nations where they can get good yield
for their assets and its safety.

This reserved group of individuals, whom our firm personally holding their
assets instructed and approached us with a mandate to seek for a firm or an
individual such as yourself who has the experience and capacity to receive
their assets and re-invest it into a good lucrative investment. They will
be interested to seeking means of expanding and relocating his business
interest in the following sectors: Banking/Finance, Real estate, Stock,
Resort/hospitality industry, Mining, Transportation, Health Sector and
Farming, Airline, Shipping, Oil and Gas, Energy Projects and so on or any
sector you may recommend will be considered.

I have been given the full authority to negotiate with you on the working
Terms, as long as you can demonstrate that you have the capacity to handle
the project. I can be reached on the phone, but will like to keep the
number discrete for now, until when I read from you. Please treat it as
urgent.

please reply to my private email with your contact details to enable me
reach you with the full details, email:

Best Regards,
Frederick Benarld.
