Attention; Fund Beneficiary,

After going through the Federal Reserve Bank and other banks payment
records here in the state, your name and information was discovered among
the beneficiaries who have not received their payment despite all the
inconveniences and financial commitments you have invested towards the
pursuit of the fund, and while verifying the reasons you have not received
this payment, we could not find any genuine reason why your funds have not
been released to you. Hence your file confirms that you have fulfilled all
necessary obligations regarding the fund release.

Now we've been prompted to intervene on this matter based on the series of
reports we have received from various beneficiaries
locally/internationally, and since our involvement in this payment
dispensation, several beneficiaries have received/confirmed their funds in
their various private bank accounts. We assure you that yours would never
be an exception once you follow our directives, hence we are dedicating
100% assiduity in making sure that all affected beneficiaries received
their payments now.

Therefore, for further assistance on this subject, contact us by email
below for our commencement and more information and directions.

Note, immediately upon the confirmation of the above required information
from you, we shall assign any of the leading banks here in the state to
execute your fund transfer with immediate effect and forward the report
file to us for our confirmation. Be rest assured that this fund release
would not exceed 48 hours upon the receipt of the above information from
you.

Thank you.
