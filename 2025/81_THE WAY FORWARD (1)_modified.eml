Dear Sir,

So sorry for the embarrassment or inconveniences this message might cause
you. Your E-mail identity is among the Beneficiaries emails on the lists to
receive their inheritance fund of Four Million, Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars. So send your original names to check if it
corresponds with the one on the payment list.

In this regard, I want you to know it will not be a difficult task to
transfer this fund into your designated bank account should you give me
your audience and follow instructions accordingly. I want us to proceed
more intelligently and confidentially because of my position here in the
bank. My decision to link you up with this is like I am revealing the
secrets of the bank's management to you but, as long as I am right before
God in rendering assistance to one in need I think I have nothing to worry
or fear about only my safety.

The past officials with the Central Bank never did well, rather, brought
shame to the country and the entire financial institutions in the country.
They can never tell you the truth or what it will take to release your
funds to you rather, they will allow you to spend your hard earned money
unnecessarily and at the end they will end up not fulfilling or achieving
your aims rather, would want the fund to be confiscated because of their
selfish interest.

I must help to satisfy your want but you should assure me of safety and
follow instructions accordingly. You need to know the status of your funds
and cause for the delay. This is like a Mafia setting and you may not
understand because you are far away. The only document needed to release
this fund to you is the Original Certificate of Non-residual as
aforementioned in my previous message which will be tendered to any of your
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for clearance of the transferred amount in
your account.

To this end, I will introduce you to Dr. Babatunde Victor Adeniran, he is
straight, trustworthy, and will never lie to you. He is the departmental
head to issue you this Certificate. You can contact him now at
[removed] let him know your file is marked X and your
released disk painted with RED colored ink so he can understand and give
urgent attention to this.

After going through this email, go ahead and contact Dr. Babatunde Victor
Adeniran so that he will give urgent attention to this positively. Let me
know the outcome of the discussions you may have with him.

Wait to hear from you.

Regards,
Mrs. Imelda Johnson
(Confidential Secretary to the Governor Central Bank of Nigeria)
