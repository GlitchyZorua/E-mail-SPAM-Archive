*Attention Carrie,Sequel to non reply of our last two letters to you, am
re-sending the message once again with hope that you will respond
accordingly.The British High Commission in the Republic of Benin, Ghana,
Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Great Britain and Nigeria has received a fraud
report against you and other British, American, European, Malaysian and
Japanese nationals. The government of these five West African countries
whose citizens were involved in these fraudulent activities have
established a committee to compensate all victims of the fraud due to
pressure from the UN and the international community. This compensation is
in categories below:Category A: $3.8M (Three Million Eight Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars).Category B: $2.6M (TWO Million Six Hundreds Thousand
United States Dollars).Category C: $1.6M (One Million Six Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars).Category D: $500,000.00 (Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars).Category E: 120,000.00 (One Hundred and Twenty
Thousand United States Dollars).Meanwhile, your name and the names of other
fraud victims have been sent to this committee for compensation. All
affected victims received their compensation via ATM CARD.However, your ATM
CARD was among those reported as unclaimed under category (D) and we would
like to advise you to follow the instructions of the committee below to
ensure that you get your ATM CARD for immediate use.The ATM Card has been
issued on the basis of the email address/name which is alleged to have been
defrauded/cheated in the past and has been confirmed by the
government/committee through Western Union Money Transfer and MoneyGram
assistant. Any victim who did not confirm their own ATM CARD is presumed
dead and their next of kin do not have access to their information, so they
were unaware of the ongoing compensation funds. The total amount credited
to your ATM CARD is only $500,000.00 (Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars).We
recommend that you do everything necessary to ensure that you receive your
ATM CARD without further delay. You are assured of the safety and
availability of the ATM CARD. Please note that you should further cease
contact/communication with all bogus lawyers and security companies that
have defrauded you in the past.Contact Reverend Father Daniel Komi with the
