Central Bank of Nigeria,
Plot 33, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Way
Central Business District,
Cadastral Zone,
Abuja, Federal Capital Territory,
P.M.B. 0187, Garki Abuja.
Nigeria.

Dear Sir/Ma,

Hurry now and claim your funds with the Central Bank or your funds will be
confiscated by the wicked officials of the bank. My name is Mrs. Imelda
Johnson, I am 42 years old, and I just started working with the Central
Bank. I came across your file marked X and your released disk painted RED.
I took time to study it and tried to find out why your fund has not been
released to you.

The evil officials here can never tell you the truth that they won't
release the funds to you; instead they allow you to spend your money
unnecessarily. I should not be a justification for inequality hence this
message. I do not intend to work here forever. I can help you claim your
funds if you can certify me of my security and assure me that you would
settle with me after you have received your payment.

I must do this because you need to know the status of your inheritance
funds and cause for the delay. This is like a Mafia setting and you may not
understand because you are far away. The only document needed to release
this fund to you is the Original Certificate of non-residual which will be
tendered to any of your Internal Revenue Service IRS for clearance of the
transferred amount in your account.

The only authorized and sincere person who will issue you the Original
Documents is Dr. Babatunde Victor Adeniran. I will give you his contact as
soon as I get a response from you. While you will be writing or
communicating with him through phone or email, you must indicate to him
that your file has been marked X with color Red so he will be able to
recognize your file.

Do get back to me ASAP if you are still interested in claiming your funds,
you will be guided accordingly on the process.

Yours Sincerely,
Mrs. Imelda Johnson
(The Confidential Secretary To The Governor Central Bank Of Nigeria)
