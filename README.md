# E-mail-SPAM-Archive

This is an archive of spam that I received since 2023.

Sometimes, the information within the header of the email will be stripped off, for privacy reasons.

If you want to see much, much, older (and more) spam, Please visit untroubles spam archive: http://untroubled.org/spam/

Or if you wanna see how i got inspired by Scambaiting, I got inspired by this video on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lShv3v-_NZ4
